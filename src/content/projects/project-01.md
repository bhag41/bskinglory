## Project Overview

Marathi is one of the Indian Language, spoken by millions of people around the world, but mainly in State of Maharashtra. The Marathi digital-scape was devoid of a women-centric, women-led support group/discussion forum. Hence I started maitrin.com in February 2015. (Yup, just celebrated the 10th Birthday!)

## Technical Challenges

Discussion forums need to be very flexible and dynamic. They need to have an ability to support tons of articles, comments, pictures and other features. maitrin being a Marathi website, support to Marathi language, having the interface (mostly) in Marathi is also a must. Drupal comes very handy in this cases. It has excellent structure to support both those needs.
