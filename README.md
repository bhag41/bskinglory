# Bsk in Glory...

Hi, this is Bhagyashree Kulkarni. If that name is difficult, I also go by bk or bsk (hence the blog name!)

I am Computer Engineer having 10+ years of experience in Web and Software Development. I am also Founder/Developer, a volunteering, communmity building efforts at maitrin.com. ( It is built on LAMP stack, using Drupal. My current side project is to migrate it to either latest Drupal or something more headless-y. Let's see how that goes.)

You can find more about me on this website also my resume.

I love to learn about latest trends in tech world. One such effort was to do 5 day intensive GenAI course by Google/Kaggle. The capstone project needed to have an accompanying blogpost, so I was in dire need of a blog. I love to write but I never maintained a tech blog, so here is one. I hope to write about my tech wanderings, journey and hope I land on magnificent destinations along the way! :)
